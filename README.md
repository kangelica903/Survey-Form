# Survey-Form
A survey form that collects data from users 
In this course, I learn HTML forms by building a signup page. I learn how to control what types of data people can type into your form, and some new CSS tools for styling your page.

I used HTML to design the basic layout of the form and CSS will give a beautiful design to our layout like text-decoration, text color, background color, text alignment, margin, padding, etc. I created a <form> element that is used to create an HTML form for user input. Inside the form element, there are different options like like name, email, age, etc. In HTML, I learned different input elements have different tasks. I also used the radio-button (user selection have provided choices.), check-button (user select zero or more options of the provided choices), and submit-button (the button for submitting the form data to a form-handler).
