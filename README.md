# Survey-Form
A survey form that collects data from users 
In this course, I learn HTML forms by building a signup page. I learn how to control what types of data people can type into your form, and some new CSS tools for styling your page.

I uses HTML to design the basic layout of the form and CSS will give a beautiful design to our layout like text-decoration, text color, background color, text alignment, margin, padding, etc.
